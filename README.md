# Multi-level Collaborative Learning for Multi-Target Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation

## Datasets

By default, the datasets are put in ``<root_dir>/Dataset``. Similar to [CoaST](https://github.com/Mael-zys/CoaST/).

## step 1: Pre-trained models

 ```bash
sh pretrain.sh
 ```

## step 2: Pseudo-labels initialization and train models

 ```bash
sh train.sh
 ```

## step 3: Evaluation


 ```bash
sh test.sh
 ```
